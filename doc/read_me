This vob consists of all the required documentation for the project.

Major Fix: October 27, 2016:
		Two task RTOS running without reset. Proper context switching is done without yield function.
		Scheduler used works in round robin fashion. Need to add more tasks.
		Functionality for thread states, semaphores are to be included.
		Scheduler logic should be changed to priority based pre-emption.
